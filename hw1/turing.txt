; Write a turing machine program (state table) to convert a binary number on the tape into that many "x" characters.
;
; Input: "110"  (=4+2 = 6 in binary)
; Output: "xxxxxx" (plus any scrap remnants of the number, these are easy to erase)
;
; Hint: decrement the number, then add one x, repeat.

; 0. Check for single or multiple zeros as the initial tape.
z 0 _ r z
z 1 1 r s
z _ _ * halt-zero

; 1. Move right until we hit a space.
s 0 0 r s
s 1 1 r s
s x x r s
s _ _ l b

; 2. Borrow state: decrement a 1 to 0 and stop, or borrow a 0 to 1 and keep looking.
b 0 1 l b
b 1 0 l w
b x x r t
b _ _ l w

; 3. Writing state: tape into that many "x" characters.
w 1 1 l w
w 0 0 l w
w x x l w
w ⍰ _ l t
w _ x l t

; 4. Traceback state: scrap remnants of the number.
t _ _ r s
t 1 ⍰ r t
t ⍰ _ l t
t x x * halt-erase
